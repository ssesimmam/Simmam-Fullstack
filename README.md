## 🛠 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🚀 Railway Deployment

This repository is ready for a two-service Railway deployment without Docker:

1. **Frontend service**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start`
   - Set these Railway variables before the build runs:
     - `VITE_API_URL` to your backend Railway URL, for example `https://your-backend.up.railway.app`
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`
     - `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` if you use frontend Sentry reporting

2. **Backend service**
   - Keep the API on its own Railway service.
   - Set `FRONTEND_URL` to the deployed frontend origin so the API CORS allowlist accepts browser requests from that domain.

3. **Production preview locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

   The static server serves `dist/` and falls back to `index.html` for SPA routes.
